Thanks for visiting my page!

I am a doctoral candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the Department of Mental Health. I am pursuing my PhD in Mental Health and a concurrent MHS in Biostatistics. I have been trained through a T32 in Data Integration for Causal Inference, directed by Dr. Elizabeth Stuart and Dr. Rashelle Musci, and a T32 in Psychiatric Epidemiology, directed by Dr. Heather Volk and Dr. Peter Zandi. I have a background in public health implementation, both within the United States and internationally. 

I am a public health methodologist with a substantive focus in suicide prevention. I have two primary research focuses: clinical prediction modeling for suicide prevention and treatment effect heterogeneity in suicide prevention efforts. Given both the rarity of suicide-related outcomes and the lack of strongly predicted risk and protective factors, I utilize machine learning methods to develop and update clinical risk prediction models for future suicidal behavior. I am particularly interested in disparate performance across population subgroups and in using transfer learning methods to update predictive models in sparse-data settings.

Further, I am interested in understanding how the effects of suicide prevention interventions differ by participant or patient characteristics using causal inference methodologies. My work focuses on methods for data harmonization and integrated analysis of multiple clinical trials to study treatment-effect heterogeneity. Additionally, I am interested in using models of individual treatment effects to better characterize differences in average treatment effects between trials.

In my free time, I enjoy running, tennis, cooking, and hiking with my dog, Clea.

I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities in the greater Boston Area.
